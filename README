Gluster-Object is the "Unified File and Object Store", which we can use to
access objects as files and files as objects on the glusterfs volume.

It can work any distributed FS, provided the pluging for it.
Right now it uses the plugin for Glusterfs by default, see
gluster-object/swift/plugins.

To use this you should have glusterfs installed.

Steps to start gluster-object:->
1>goto UFO directory.
2>Run sh <ubuntu/centos/ssa>_install.sh as per your distribution.
3>Provide all the config parameters.

At the completion of <..>_install.sh, gluster-object servers should be running on
your system.

It should start proxy, object, container and account servers and all config
files should be get copied to /etc/gluster-object/
